### Explanation:
1. **Code Blocks**: Used triple backticks (```) for the "Project Structure" section to display directory hierarchy as a block.
2. **Screenshots Table**: Used the pipe (`|`) symbol to create a Markdown table for Desktop and Mobile views.
3. **License**: Provided the standard Markdown header and text for clarity.

This formatting is clean and works seamlessly for GitHub or any Markdown renderer. Let me know if you need additional sections!
